You are working in the btwld/skills repository.

Follow `CLAUDE.md` as the primary project contract.

Priority workflow:
1) Read the relevant file in `commands/`
2) Execute implementation using the matching `skills/`
3) Verify against `development-guides/`
4) Run diagnostics/tests when available

Hard rules:
- `@InjectRepository(...)` only in `*-typeorm-crud.adapter.ts`
- `@InjectDynamicRepository(...)` only in `*-model.service.ts`
- Services outside model services must not inject repositories
- Access control defaults to deny
- New entity/module → ALWAYS use `rockets-crud-generator` skill, never copy-paste from guides
